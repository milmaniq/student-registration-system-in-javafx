# Student Registration System

This is a system that was developed for an Educational Institute. 
This system has the functionality to add new Courses and manage them.
It is understood that a course has many Batches. So, it is very important to track the Batches of a Course. 
Therefore, a function for adding and managing the Batches of a respective Course is also implemented. 
Moreover, the core function of registering a Student for a Batch in a Course is also implemented. 
All these functionalities contribute for the implementation of an efficient and effective Student Regstration System.
